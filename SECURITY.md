## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Always use the latest version of WebAudioTranscriber
- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Run the application with the principle of least privilege
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA where available

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement proper input validation
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set secure HTTP headers
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Audio Processing**: The application processes audio files which could potentially contain malicious content. Always validate and sanitize file uploads.

2. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration should be managed through environment variables and never committed to version control.

3. **Dependencies**: We regularly update our dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.

4. **Authentication**: If implementing user accounts, use industry-standard authentication libraries and practices.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1). We recommend always running the latest patch version.
